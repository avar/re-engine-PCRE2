0.06 Sun Apr 9 11:25:35 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Add BENCHMARKS to documentation: 40% faster

0.05 Sun Apr 9 10:48:20 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Harmonize re_tests with core, add version specifics
    - Document failing tests, with PCRE2 vs older perls.
      It's about the same, when the biggest problem, no utf8 patterns
      with utf8 subjects is fixed. Arguably PCRE2 is even better.
